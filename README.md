Frequently requesting location updates may cause battery drain of mobile devices, while displaying inappropriate notifications my distract or even disturb users. Our goal is to track how applications use those API and find better solution to improve user experience.

## What Steel collects
In short, Steel only collects which application requested location update or posted notifications, detailed contents are **not** logged to protect your privacy.

In addition, if you enabled location permission, your coarse location will be recorded.

We won't log any personal information, containing device ID, phone number, so all your data will be kept anonymous.
